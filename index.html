          <p>Hello! My name is Tim and welcome to my website!</p>
          <p>I'm a software engineer specialising in mobile platforms - Swift is my first preference, so iOS/macOS apps are my happy place (Objective-C at a push)!</p>
          <p></p>I've also been known to work on Android projects (Kotlin and Java) and C# (when I have to go cross platform!). When not in the mobile world, I've also been enjoying experimenting with Rust and boosting my C++ skills.</p>
          <p>Outside of coding, I can often be found either composing music in Logic, in the kitchen cooking, or in the garden working on the veg patch!</p>
          <p>On weekends, I may also be found at the badminton court or the bouldering wall, or walking in the Highlands.</p>

            <h5 class="section-subheader">Owl</h5>
            <p class="italic secondary">Alpha Coming Soon!</p>
            <p>An iOS and macOS app for organising projects and writing. I couldn't decide on a note taking/task management/long form writing app combination, so I'm making my own. This has been through a few iterations, but I'm really pleased with this latest one so hopefully I'll get an alpha ready soon!</p>

            <p><a class="link" href="https://github.com/mtyn/polar">Available on GitHub</a></p>
            <p>A light, wintery color scheme - an unofficial light version of the excellent <a class="link" href="https://www.nordtheme.com">Nord Theme</a> ported to a variety of apps, editors and terminals.</p>

            <p class="italic secondary">Coming <span class="strikethrough">soon</span> eventually</p>
            <p>A fun side project to create an exploration and management game. An iOS/macOS SpriteKit game, a weird cross between Stardew Valley, Zelda and Spiritfarer. Still in the very early days of experiments and prototypes!</p>
